# Gilded Rose

This is my version of a JavaScript/Jest refactor of the well known "Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata". I really enjoyed this exercise, as I found the Test-Driven Development model to be very intuitive. It also allowed me to expand my knowledge of Classes and Inheritance, something I had only used briefly in my previous work.

If you're unfamiliar with the kata, the requirements for it are [here](GildedRoseRequirements.txt)
